# Social goals of Jehanne

Jehanne is an educational tool: I want people to learn how to
admin, program and extend it.

To this aim I want to build the simplest possible distributed
operating system that can provide all the services people expect
from a modern operating system and much more.

As a research tool, it want to challenge as many well established
assumptions as possible, such as the need of POSIX.

It also want to bring new ideas to OS research, expanding the
Overton window in this field.

I want its distributed design and protocol to challenge the Web.
