# Social goals of Jehanne

Jehanne is an educational tool: I want to empower people by 
turning them to hackers.

To this aim I want to build the simplest possible distributed
operating system that can provide all the services people expect
from a modern operating system and much more. This way, people
will be able to read and understand its internals and to code
their own tools for it.

As a research tool, it want to challenge as many well established
assumptions as possible, such as the need of POSIX semantics at
kernel level.

It also want to bring new ideas to OS research, expanding the
Overton window in this field.

I want its distributed design and protocol to challenge the Web,
increasing the ability of people to securely compose remote
applications without leaking personal data.
