# So long, and thanks for all the fish...

After [Microsoft's math-washed violation of Free Software hackers' copyright](http://jehanne.h--k.it/2022/01/06/jehanne_is_moving.html), 
I decided to move Jehanne elsewhere, and the [Devol](https://devol.it) collective kindly offered their hospitality on [https://gitea.it/JehanneOS](https://gitea.it/JehanneOS).

If you give a shit about Free Software and developers' rights, I recommend you to do the same.  
Otherwise, [your copylefted code will lend proprietary products](https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/E5R5lsfXoAQDRkE.mp4), without proper attribution or [correct licensing](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena/blob/dbe4ddb10315479fc00086f08e25d968b4b43c49/code/game/q_math.c#L552-L572) through the cut&paste&string-replace as a Service known as GitHub Copilot. 

To be fair, if I owned a software house pretending to develop innovative proprietary code, I would leave GitHub as soon as possible, and for the very same reason: nobody will ever be able to prove if Copilot accidentally distributed code from your private repository or not!  
**Good luck with your IP protection!** :-P 

Anyway, 804b13a4dc2f8aa577f359b2604c440d341373db is the last commit available both [on GitHub](https://github.com/JehanneOS/jehanne/commit//804b13a4dc2f8aa577f359b2604c440d341373db) and [Gitea.it](https://gitea.it/JehanneOS/jehanne/commit/804b13a4dc2f8aa577f359b2604c440d341373db).

You can keep following this project [there](https://gitea.it/JehanneOS/) and on the new website: http://jehanne.h--k.it/

# Jehanne

Jehanne is a [simple][simplicity] operating system.

Jehanne has noble ancestors:

- most of userland tools, a lot of wisdom and some kernel modules,
  come from [9front][9front]
- the kernel is a fork of Charles Forsyth's [Plan9-9k][plan9-9k]
- ~~most of the build system and~~ some valuable piece of code come from [Harvey OS][harvey]

Still the project is named after a humble peasant,
the famous French heretic [Joan of Arc][arc], because it diverges deeply
from the design and conventions of its predecessors.
